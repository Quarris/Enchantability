You can expect that the effect closely resembles the damage you would take if you didn't have it on. For example, if you $(l)jump$() off a 5 block cliff, you will take similar damage (as best as I could mimic it), even though your max height above the ground is higher. This is done to avoid you taking damage by just jumping, which Dire hates."
