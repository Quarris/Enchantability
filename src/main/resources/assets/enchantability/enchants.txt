Implemented:
=============================

Blast Protection - Has a chance to not blast blocks away, with BP4 preventing blocks explosions.

Efficiency - Increased output of manual crafting. Items affected are specified in the configs by item stacks and ore dicts.

Fire Aspect - Aids you with the power of the SUN!!!!!!!! Gives you regen during the day if you are looking directly at the sun, and weakness during night at any time.

Infinity - When you fall through the void in The End, it will teleport you back to the top of the world in the Overworld. The position in the overworld is the same as your xyz in The End, plus the natural world spawn position (not the bed). (Can be changed to no offset in configs)

Knockback - Increases the reach distance for the player.

Projectile Projection - Deflects all arrows shot at the player. Reduces the damage taken from the arrow by 0.5 * tier, so at PP4 the damage is reduced by 2 hearts.

Punch - Increases the mining speed with the empty hand, by original speed + tier.

Silktouch - Prevents hitting of animals, they sometimes get in the way.

Feather Falling - Slows down the fall of the player.

//BROKEN - not working on server// Curse of Vanishing - Turns the player completely invisible, including armour.

Frost Walker - Allow walking on air. Higher tier allows sprinting, lower tier is a little unstable and only allows walking.

Smite - Create lightning when hitting mobs with a sword of given tier.

Looting - Increased experience drop from killing mobs.

Fortune - Increase experience from smelting items.

Mending - Enhance the eaten foods with XP.

TODO Enchants:
=============================
IDEAS:
----------------
Depth Strider - Something with the Nether (Depth) and movement/maneuverability (Strider).
Protection - Gives you a second health bar, which regens after a short while of being depleted (Maybe at cost of hunger?).
Sharpness - Sharp Eyes. Add a zoom function (Using FOV?) (Zoom increases with tier?). Alternatively something with awareness.
Curse of Binding - Keeps the inventory on death, destroying the book afterwards.
Lure - Lures passive animals without the need for their item. (Range increases with tier?).
Mending - Make Amends? Maybe disable/reduce villager trade blocking?
    Alternative, gives player Saturation.
    Alternative pt2, Heals players slightly when gathering xp.
<<<<<<< HEAD:enchants.txt
    Alternative pt3, Enhances eaten foods with the cost of XP.
=======
    Alternative pt3, Foods get enhanced when eaten at cost of XP.
>>>>>>> enchant-mending:src/main/resources/assets/enchantability/enchants.txt
Fire Protection - Temporary immunity to lava, will not catch on fire or take damage for a while (1 second per level?)

REST:
----------------

Vanishing: The render cancelling doesnt work on servers
